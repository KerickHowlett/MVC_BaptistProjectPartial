# Baptist Health Reverse Auctioning System

This was part of a project my team, Cardinal Solutions collaborated together on for our contracted client, Baptist Health's Supply Chain Solution department, as a part of our school curriculum at the University of Louisville.

We treated it like professional part-time work, because that's exactly what it was. None of us had any idea what we were doing back in 2014; we kept overriding each other's work in GitHub, because none of us knew that we didn't know about GitFlow.

Out of the other teams in the class who competed that year, ours was the one chosen. Despite how terrible the user interface looked terrible, because I had no idea what UI/UX designs were at the time.

#### The Technologies I can recall:
* ASP.NET 4 MVC
* C# (C-Sharp)
* CSS (Just plain CSS -- no SCSS or SASS!)
* JavaScript
* AJAX
* Software Development Life-cycle
